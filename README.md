# Drum-Kit--by-Java-Script
<b>This Project I have made by The Help of the Following things :--</b>
<h2>HTML</h2>
<p><b>HTML is the base of any web application or web page. It helps to display the data in formatted manner like heading, paragraph and links which is easy for layman to read and interact with your product information/data.</b></p>

<h2>CSS</h2>
<p><b>CSS is used along with HTML and JavaScript in most websites to create user interfaces for web applications and user interfaces for many mobile applications.</b></p>

<h2>Java Script</h2>
<p><b>When used with HTML and CSS, Java Script creates the most dynamic and interactive pages. JavaScript allows webpages to respond to user activity and dynamically update themselves, and all without requiring a page reload to change its appearance. </b></p>

<h2>Document Object Model</h2>
<p><b>By the Help of the Java Script I have used the DOM.By which I have selected the element/tags/attributes of HTML,CSS to make some further changes in our website </b></p>
